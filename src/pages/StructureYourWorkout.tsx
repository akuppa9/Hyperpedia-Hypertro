            Understanding how your body's muscles function and learning the most
            effective ways to promote their growth is a crucial aspect of
            hypertrophy training. However, the effectiveness of this knowledge
            is significantly enhanced when supplemented by proper programming
            and structure in your workout. When programming a workout, the
            possibilities are limitless, but it is essential to focus on three
            crucial topics: volume, exercise selection, and order.

            Current research suggests that the ideal range for muscle growth is
            10-20 sets per muscle per week. To minimize CNS fatigue, it is
            advisable to aim for around 10 sets with a resting period of
            approximately 3 minutes. While there are various workout splits
            available, the choice ultimately depends on personal preference. For
            those with limited gym availability, options like a full-body split
            or an upper/lower split can be effective. Alternatively, a 3-day
            split is suitable for more experienced lifters, such as
            Push/Pull/Legs or the Arnold split (chest and back, arms, and legs).
            Regardless of the split structure, the goal is to achieve around 10
            high-intensity sets per muscle group.
            <br />
            <br />
            Research indicates that when weekly volume is equated between
            different splits, outcomes are very similar. It's advisable to limit
            the total number of different workouts to fewer than 7 per day, with
            approximately 1-3 sets taken to failure per given exercise.
            Additionally, incorporating rest days into your program is crucial
            to prevent overworking your body.

            While putting maximum effort into an exercise is essential, the
            choice of exercise matters. Prioritize stable exercises, especially
            if your goal is building muscle rather than strength. Machines are
            typically the most stable, followed by cables, and then dumbbells.
            Minimize redundancies in your workout, such as avoiding different
            exercises for the same muscle through the same plane of motion
            (e.g., dumbbell curl vs cable curl). However, when dealing with
            larger muscles such as the chest or lats, more than one exercise
            variation may be needed to effectively target different regions of
            the muscle.
            <br />
            <br />A general rule of thumb for compound exercises is that, of all
            the muscles involved, the muscle that changes length the most will
            be more active in the movement. This technique can be important in
            making changes to an exercise to bias certain muscles. For example,
            in a wide grip pulldown versus a close grip pulldown, since there is
            a higher degree of bicep flexion in the close grip pulldown, there
            will be less lat stimulation and more bicep stimulation compared to
            the wide grip pulldown. This is the same reason why the close grip
            bench press is a tricep exercise.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beginners can often see significant results in various muscle groups
            with compound exercises such as the bench press. This is due to
            lower threshold muscle fibers starting to develop, a phenomenon
            called 'Newbie Gains.' However, as the lifter advances, the body
            undergoes neuromechanical matching, directing motor units to the
            strongest muscle groups. This prioritizes the stimulation of one
            muscle while neglecting others involved in the compound movement.
            Despite this, the spread of motor units across a large area makes
            compound exercises less efficient than isolation exercises. Hence,
            as lifters progress, isolation exercises become increasingly
            important.

            The order of exercises in a workout significantly influences
            results. Ideally, start with the most challenging movements when
            energy levels are highest. Prioritize the muscle group you want to
            emphasize at the beginning of the workout, as the central nervous
            system is most capable of activating high-threshold motor neurons
            during this time. However, in a PPL split, if you're working out
            your back, avoid fatiguing the biceps before targeting your back, as
            the biceps play a crucial role in pulling motions.
            <br />
            <br />
            When performing different exercises for the same muscle, prioritize
            the exercise that puts peak tension in the shortened position first,
            followed by the exercise that puts peak tension in a longer
            position. This sequencing minimizes muscle damage and maximizes
            muscle growth, particularly in lengthened positions, which can be
            more hypertrophic (as observed in many leg muscles). For example,
            when working out legs, start with leg extensions to contract the
            quads (peak tension at the top) and follow it with squats when the
            quads are more stretched.

                different muscle groups. Due to no rest period, motor
                recruitment is very low in the following set (even if it is a
                different muscle group). This method is not very effective
                without an adequate resting period.

                Myo Reps is a technique composed of a main set taken to 1-2 RIR,
                followed by a 20-second rest period, and then a cluster set of
                3-5 reps with 1 RIR. This sequence is repeated until the final
                set is taken to failure. Typically, 4-5 cluster sets are
                performed, each with around 3 stimulating reps. Research has
                shown that this technique is the most efficient in terms of
